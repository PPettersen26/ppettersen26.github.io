                <p>I am an experienced programming professional from Chicago, but that is not the limit to my skills. 
                   I have worked as a professional chef and did freelance photography thru college.  
                   I never seem to go far from any of these three specialties. </p>

                </p>
                <p>While working on my first bachelor’s degree in computer science, 
                    I was doing a lot of landscape photography, team pictures and even wedding photography. 
                    After graduation, I was hired by Allstate Insurance in Life Systems. 
                    I worked my way up there to a Senior Staff Programmer. I did not just program. 
                    I started training under a professional chef in Chicago, Cleatis Wilcox, 
                    the first certified female chef in the Midwest.  Cooking must be in my blood! 
                    My family even includes a chef who worked at the American Embassy in Oslo, Norway! 
                    After marrying I moved to Michigan where I cooked professionally and did IT consulting work. </p>
                <p>Computers were never far from my mind either. 
                    I worked on methods of storing my vast library of recipes. 
                    I also needed ways to calculate portions and nutritional values because of family food allergies 
                    and my work as a sous chef at a retirement home. A lot of my work was done with Visual Basic, 
                    stand-alone apps and Excel macros. . In the kitchen I worked on inventory, scheduling and ordering 
                    systems. I also helped set up a network for a medical practice and a database for a 
                    local horticultural therapy farm where I was their volunteer coordinator.</p>

                </p>
                <p>I used my photography to document recipes and cooking methods. I have always have enjoyed landscape 
                    and close-up work. This came in handy to document my work. 
                    I used to have a dark room but now my dark room is my keyboard using Photoshop. </p>

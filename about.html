           <p>After receiving a Bachelor&#39s degree in computer science at Northeastern Illinois University, 
               I was hired by Allstate Insurance to work in Life systems. My tasks included:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>Project lead, Requirements Definition, Analysis and design</li>
                <li>Debugging & Troubleshooting</li>
                <li>Testing & Documentation</li>
                <li>New employee and User Training & Support</li>
                <li>Policy exhibit and valuation department</li>
                <li>Billing and Collections - worked on first electronic funds transfer system with 
                    Chase Manhattan Bank</li>
                <li>Programed with COBOL and Assembler on an IBM 370 mainframe</li>
           </ul>
            <p>While working on my first bachelor&#39s degree in computer science, I was doing a lot of 
                landscape photography, team pictures and even wedding photography. I did not just program 
                at Allstate either. I started training under a professional chef in Chicago, Cleatis Wilcox, 
                the first certified female chef in the Midwest. Cooking must be in my blood too! My family 
                includes a chef who worked at the American Embassy in Oslo, Norway! After marrying I moved to 
                Michigan where I cooked professionally and also did IT consulting work. </p>
            <p>My roles as a chef included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Baker</li>
                <li>Line Cook in a resort area</li>
                <li>Prep Cook</li>
                <li>Sous Chef for a retirement home (Kitchen manager)</li>
                <li>Recipes developed for special dietary needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Computers were never far from my mind either. I worked on storage methods for my vast 
                library of recipes. I createdd ways to calculate portions and nutritional values because of 
                special dietary needs. A lot of my work was done with Visual Basic, stand-alone apps through 
                Excel macros. In the kitchen I worked on inventory, scheduling and ordering systems. 
                Other consulting work I did was set up a network for a medical practice and a database for a local 
                horticultural therapy farm where I was their volunteer coordinator.</p>
            <p>My volunteer activities included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Volunteer Coordinator/Systems advisor for a horticultural therapy farm</li>
                <li>Culinary instructor for a middle school</li>
                <li>Scout leader</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In 2010 I decided to return to college for another Bachelor&#39s degree. I wanted to update my skills 
                and learn new skills. Learning Web tools and .Net has been good for me to continue with projects 
                since then. I have learned C# and have really expanded my experience with SQL.</p> 
                
            <p>Technologies I have used since then include:</p>            
            <ul>
                <li>COBOL</li>
                <li>C#.Net</li>
                <li>VB</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>Html/Css</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Database work included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SQL Server/DB2</li>
                <li>Advanced queries</li>
                <li>Schema design</li>
                <li>Stored Procedures</li>
                <li>SSRS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I continue using my photography to document recipes and cooking methods, and have enjoyed 
                landscape and close-up work. This came in handy to document culinary prep and in Web design. 
                Originally I had a dark room but now my dark room is my computer using Photoshop where I can be 
                even more creative.</p>
            <p>My Web and Image design include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Web design using Dreamweaver , Visual Studio and other tools</li>
                <li>Web images produced using Photoshop, Gimp, Fireworks, Flash, and Illustrator</li>
                <li>Web functionality produced using javascript, perl, and jquery.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I love to create, either with graphics, computer project design and coding or 
                with culinary dietary design. I appreciate a well-designed project that is tested well 
                and a responsive design.</p>
